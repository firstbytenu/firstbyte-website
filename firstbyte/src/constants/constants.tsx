I've always had a passion for teaching, and computer science was my major so it seemed natural. What I stumbled upon was a tight-knit family, where everyone is super passionate about what they do and supports each other to the fullest. I loved FirstByte's mission of making high-quality education accessible to anyone, and that's something I really wanted to be a part of.",
