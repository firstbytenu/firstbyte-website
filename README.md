# FirstByte Website

This project is the source code for the FirstByte website, a Northeastern's organization website built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It features a modern design with responsive components and interactive elements.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed the latest version of Node.js. This project uses `npm` for dependency management.

## Installation

Clone the repository and nav into the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/firstbytenu/firstbyte-website.git
cd firstbyte-website
cd firstbyte
```
Ensure you are in the firstbyte folder, not the firstbyte-website workspace.

Install the project dependencies
```
npm i
```

## Starting the development server

To start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
This command will start the Vite development server and also the Gulp tasks. Open http://localhost:5173 to view the website locally in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
